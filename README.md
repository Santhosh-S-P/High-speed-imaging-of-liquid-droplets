# High-speed-imaging-of-liquid-droplets

In this project, we use an Arduino, a laser, and a laser detector module to detect liquid droplets and automatically trigger a flash to capture their interaction with different surfaces. You can find more on this [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SfcDG2f1RQBpgZJfbiuvluQvEYPHseO_IVerElDfGsY/edit?usp=sharing).

1. The files [alignment_check.ino](https://github.com/Santhosh-S-P/High-speed-imaging-of-liquid-droplets/blob/main/alignment_check.ino) and [droplet_detection_code.ino](https://github.com/Santhosh-S-P/High-speed-imaging-of-liquid-droplets/blob/main/droplet_detection_code.ino) are the Arduino codes used to check the alignment of the setup and to detect the droplet respectively.

2. The MATLAB files [analysing_droplets_draft.mlx](https://github.com/Santhosh-S-P/High-speed-imaging-of-liquid-droplets/blob/main/analysing_droplets_draft.mlx) and 
[analysing_droplets_draft2.mlx](https://github.com/Santhosh-S-P/High-speed-imaging-of-liquid-droplets/blob/main/analysing_droplets_draft2.mlx) does some image processing to seperate out the droplet and measure its size.

3. The file [High speed imaging of droplets.pdf](https://github.com/Santhosh-S-P/High-speed-imaging-of-liquid-droplets/blob/main/High%20speed%20imaging%20of%20droplets.pdf) contains a montage of some images using the setup with different delays in [droplet_detection_code.ino](https://github.com/Santhosh-S-P/High-speed-imaging-of-liquid-droplets/blob/main/droplet_detection_code.ino).
